# Glossary

<details>

<summary>Agent</summary>

Hyperlane [agents](../protocol/agents/relayer.mdx) are off-chain actors that read and write Hyperlane smart contract state.

Example agents include [validators](../protocol/agents/validators.mdx) and [relayer](../protocol/agents/relayer.mdx).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Aggregation ISM</summary>

The [Aggregation ISM](../reference/ISM/aggregation-ISM-interface.mdx) is a type of interchain security module that aggregates security from many [ISMs](../reference/ISM/specify-your-ISM.mdx) by requiring that `m` of `n` ISMs verify a particular interchain message.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Checkpoint</summary>

A checkpoint is a (merkle root, index) tuple, corresponding to the state of the [mailbox](glossary.mdx#mailbox)incremental merkle tree at a particular point in time.

Checkpoints signatures by [Validators](glossary.mdx#validator) are used in [Multisig ISMs](glossary.mdx#multisig-ism).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Collateral chain</summary>

For a [Warp Route](glossary.mdx#warp-route), the chain on which the [collateral token](glossary.mdx#collateral-token) is deposited into the warp route.

Read more about [deploy warp route](../guides/deploy-warp-route.mdx)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Collateral token</summary>

For a [Warp Route](glossary.mdx#warp-route), the token which is deposited on the [collateral chain](glossary.mdx#collateral-chain) to create a wrapped token on a remote [synthetic chain](glossary.mdx#synthetic-chain).

Read more about [deploy warp route](../guides/deploy-warp-route.mdx)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Default ISM</summary>

The [interchain security module](glossary.mdx#interchain-security-module) that will be used to verify inbound messages if the message recipient has not specified their own ISM.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Domain</summary>

A unique identifier for a particular chain, used by the Hyperlane protocol to determine message origin and destination.

May be the same as the EVM chain ID, but isn't always. See [domains](domains/) for a list of known Hyperlane domain IDs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Interchain accounts (ICA)</summary>

A [middleware](glossary.mdx#middleware) smart contract that allows users to make interchain smart contract calls.

For example, DAOs can use interchain accounts to own contracts on remote chains.

See Interchain Accounts for more information.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Interchain gas paymaster</summary>

A smart contract deployed by a [relayer](glossary.mdx#relayer) that accepts payments on an origin chain for message delivery on destination chains.

See [interchain gas payments](../protocol/interchain-gas-payment.mdx) for more information

</details>

<details>

<summary>Interchain queries (IQS)</summary>

A [middleware](glossary.mdx#middleware) smart contract that allows users to make interchain view calls.

For example, smart contracts can use interchain queries to look up oracle exchange rates or token balances from a remote chain.

See Interchain Queries (IQS) for more information.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Interchain security module</summary>

[Interchain Security Module](./ISM/specify-your-ISM.mdx) (ISMs) are smart contracts that provide security to Hyperlane's interchain [mailbox](./messaging/messaging-interface.mdx).

ISMs are responsible for verifying that interchain messages being delivered on the destination chain were _actually sent_ on the origin chain.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Mailbox</summary>

Arguably the most important Hyperlane smart contract, the [mailbox](./messaging/messaging-interface.mdx) exposes an interface that developers can use to [send](./messaging/send.mdx) and [receive](./messaging/receive.mdx) interchain messages.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Middleware</summary>

A smart contract that sends and receives messages, and exposes a developer facing API. Developers are expected use this API instead of interacting directly with the [mailbox](glossary.mdx#mailbox). 

Example middlewares include [interchain-accounts-ica](glossary.mdx#interchain-accounts-ica) and [interchain-queries-iqs](glossary.mdx#interchain-queries-iqs)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Multisig ISM</summary>

The [multisig ISM](./ISM/multisig-ISM-interface.mdx) is a type of [interchain security module](glossary.mdx#interchain-security-module) that uses `m` of `n` [validator](glossary.mdx#validator) signatures in order to verify a particular interchain message.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Relayer</summary>

The [relayer](../operate/relayer/run-relayer.mdx) are Hyperlane [agents](glossary.mdx#agent) responsible for delivering messages from their origin chain(s) to their destination chain(s).

Relayers are untrusted, and anyone can operate a relayer.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Routing ISM</summary>

The Routing ISM is a type of [interchain security module](glossary.mdx#interchain-security-module) that defers to a different ISM depending on the message being delivered.

For example, a Routing ISM could use a different ISM depending on the origin chain from which the message was sent.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Synthetic chain</summary>

For a [Warp Route](glossary.mdx#warp-route), a chain on which wrapped tokens are minted. These wrapped tokens are backed by [collateral tokens](glossary.mdx#collateral-token) that have been locked on the [collateral chain](glossary.mdx#collateral-chain).

Read more about [deploy warp route](../guides/deploy-warp-route.mdx)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Validator</summary>

[Validators](../operate/validators/run-validators.mdx) are a Hyperlane [agents](glossary.mdx#agent) responsible for attesting to messages sent from an origin chain.

[Multisig ISMs](glossary.mdx#multisig-ism) use validator signatures to provide security for inbound messages.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Warp route</summary>

[deploy warp route](../guides/deploy-warp-route.mdx) are Hyperlane's take on the concept of token bridging, allowing you to permissionlessly transfer any ERC20-like asset to any chain via Hyperlane.

</details>
