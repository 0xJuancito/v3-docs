# Send

Developers can send interchain messages by calling `Mailbox.dispatch()`.

### Interface

{/* hint style="warning" */}
Hyperlane can only deliver messages to smart contracts that implement the `IMessageRecipient` interface. See the [Receive](./receive.mdx) documentation for more information.
{/* endhint */}

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Dispatches a message to the destination domain & recipient.
     * @param _destinationDomain Domain of destination chain
     * @param _recipientAddress Address of recipient on destination chain as bytes32
     * @param _body Raw bytes content of message body
     * @return The message ID inserted into the Mailbox's merkle tree
     */
    function dispatch(
        uint32 _destination,
        bytes32 _recipient,
        bytes calldata _body
    ) external returns (bytes32) {
```


### Encoding

{/* hint style="info" */}
Recipient addresses are left-padded to `bytes32` for compatibility with virtual machines that are addressed differently.
{/* endhint */}

The following utility is provided in the [`TypeCasts` library](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/libs/TypeCasts.sol) for convenience.

```solidity
// alignment preserving cast
function addressToBytes32(address _addr) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
    return bytes32(uint256(uint160(_addr)));
}
```

### Paying for Interchain Gas and Protocol Fees.

Delivering a message to its destination requires submitting a transaction on the destination chain. For that reason, there is an Interchain Gas Payment system in place to support the payment of a relayer to do that for you. You can read more about it at [https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/interchain-gas-payments](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/interchain-gas-payments). Additionally, Mailboxes may choose to charge a protocol fee.

Both the IGP payments and protocol fees are implemented as hooks and enabled as the default hook (See more under [Hooks](../hooks/overview)). Not passing enough msg.value to the `dispatch` function will cause it to revert. Thus you should generally call `quoteDispatch` on the `Mailbox` and pass that to the dispatch as so:

```solidity
uint256 quote = mailbox.quoteDispatch(destination, recipient, body);
mailbox.dispatch{value: quote}(destination, recipient, body);
```
