:::caution

This protocol overview is from our v2 contract version. 

v3 now includes [post-dispatch hooks](../reference/hooks/overview.mdx), with [interchain gas payments (IGP)](../reference/hooks/interchain-gas.mdx) as one of the required hooks. 

We are working to update it with the relevant content ASAP. In the meantime, see the fully [**updated v3 Reference**](../reference/messaging/messaging-interface.mdx) tab for the latest contract interfaces.
