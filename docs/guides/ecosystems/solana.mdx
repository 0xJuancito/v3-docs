# Solana

Hyperlane supports Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), and is currently live supporting Zebec's [Nautilus Bridge](https://medium.com/hyperlane/case-study-interoperability-for-the-modular-rollup-stack-featuring-nautilus-d01118fe31ec). In addition, it is live on [Eclipse testnet](https://medium.com/hyperlane/hyperlane-expands-to-solana-vm-in-collaboration-with-eclipse-8465616fd0e4).

Our public tooling & docs are currently EVM-only, however, though we have internal tooling that we are working to open source and develop by end of the year. If you're excited about bringing Hyperlane to Solana reach out on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperlane)!
