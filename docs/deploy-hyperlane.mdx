# Get Started

Hyperlane can be deployed by anyone to any chain. 
This guide covers sending your first interchain message from a new EVM chain.

## Overview
There are five steps in this guide:
1. [<b>Set up keys</b>](#1-set-up-keys) that you will use to deploy contracts and run validators and relayers
2. [<b>Deploy contracts</b>](#2-deploy-contracts) to the local chain and to every remote chain with which the local chain will be able to send and receive messages.
3. [<b>Run validators</b>](#3-run-validators) on your local chain, to provide the signatures needed for the sovereign consensus you deployed in step 2.
4. [<b>Run relayer</b>](#4-run-relayer) to send and receive messages between chains you deployed contracts to in step 2.
5. [<b>Send a test message</b>](#5-send-test-messages) to confirm that your relayer is able to deliver messages from and to each pair of chains

## Getting Started

## 1. Set up keys

There are three keys to set up and fund. To get started, you can simplify by using the same hexadecimal key for all three roles.

<table><thead><tr><th>Key Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Funding Needs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Contract Deployer</td><td>32 byte hexadecimal private key</td><td>Funded on all the chains on which we need to deploy contracts.</td></tr><tr><td>Validator Accounts</td><td>A list of validator addresses to configure a Multisig ISM, or just one to get started quickly</td><td>A small amount to do announce the location of the validator signatures</td></tr><tr><td>Relayer Accounts</td><td>The relayer client(s) use one account on the local chain and an additional account for each of the remote chains</td><td>Each relayer instance must be configured with a key that has a balance on all the other chains.</td></tr></tbody></table>

For instructions on how to generate keys, see the agent keys section. Your deployer key **must** be a hexadecimal key, while validator and relayer keys can be hexadecimal or AWS KMS.

If deploying on a local network using [Foundry's Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/anvil), use the following command to fund your newly-generated account. It uses one of the pre-funded private keys to transfer 1 ETH to the address in the `$YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` variable.

```
cast send $YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY \
--private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
--value $(cast tw 1)
```
