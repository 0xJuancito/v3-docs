# Agent keys

Hyperlane agents - validators and the relayer - must be configured with private keys in order to operate. Validators use private keys to sign attestations, and the relayer uses private keys to sign transactions that deliver messages.

Hyperlane agents currently support being configured with private keys in one of two ways.

## 1. Hexadecimal keys

A raw hexadecimal private key used for in-memory signing. This is the easiest and fastest setup for testing.

:::warning

Hexadecimal keys are **not** recommended for production environments. Use AWS KMS keys instead.

:::

### Generate a hexadecimal key

Keep track of your address and private key for use with your agent.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cast" label="Cast CLI">
Using [Foundry's cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/), you can create a new key pair:

```sh
cast wallet new
```

The output will look something like this:

```
Successfully created new keypair.
Address: 0x32e6d32E7b1C8691Ef4ad3841003371214a0eebC
Private Key: 0x2958f0eb2ab71bbfb5ea1422835e20e488778b61e3c107f369572e2b53b578f9
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="privatekeys" label="Using privatekeys.pw">
You can visit [https://privatekeys.pw/keys/ethereum/random](https://privatekeys.pw/keys/ethereum/random), which will automatically display a list of hexadecimal private keys and their addresses.

:::warning

Please note that because these are generated by a website, these private keys should be considered insecure and should not be used for anything other than testing purposes!

## 2. AWS KMS

A key generated by AWS and stored in a CloudHSM. This is the recommended setup for production agents, **especially** for validators.
