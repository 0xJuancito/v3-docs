# Get Started

Hyperlane can be deployed by anyone to any chain. 
This guide covers sending your first interchain message from a new EVM chain.

## Overview
There are five steps in this guide:
1. [<b>Set up keys</b>](#1-set-up-keys) that you will use to deploy contracts and run validators and relayers
2. [<b>Deploy contracts</b>](#2-deploy-contracts) to the local chain and to every remote chain with which the local chain will be able to send and receive messages.
3. [<b>Run validators</b>](#3-run-validators) on your local chain, to provide the signatures needed for the sovereign consensus you deployed in step 2.
4. [<b>Run relayer</b>](#4-run-relayer) to send and receive messages between chains you deployed contracts to in step 2.
5. [<b>Send a test message</b>](#5-send-test-messages) to confirm that your relayer is able to deliver messages from and to each pair of chains
